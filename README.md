# DiceBox

This project is an attempt to create a facny box using Open SCAD / [OOML](https://github.com/avalero/OOML)

The box is created with mind to possibility of laser cutting all its components in a plywood, to facilitate its physical crafting.
3D printable model is also planned for the unspecified future (but feel free to issue a PR sooner).
